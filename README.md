# Tic-tac-toe in React native

Tic Tac Toe application, written in React Native.

The app features a sleek and intuitive interface that makes it easy to play the game.

Players can choose to play against the computer on easy, medium, hard, or impossible difficulty, allowing them to tailor the challenge to their skill level.

In addition to the various difficulty levels, the app also includes settings that allow players to turn on or off sounds and vibrations during gameplay. This allows players to customize their gaming experience and create a more immersive or relaxed atmosphere.

In the future, will be introduced a login feature to the app, allowing players to create an account and save their game progress and statistics. This will also enable the multiplayer feature, which will allow players to invite friends to play a game of Tic Tac Toe by their nickname
